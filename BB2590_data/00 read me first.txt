Folders included
1) data: This folder includes experimental data derived from a BB2590 pack.
	--- Files named 'all_xx.mat' contain voltage, current and surface temperature measurements obtained by pulsing an ICR18650J cell. The 'xx' in the             file name indicates the temperature of the ambient and hence the resting tempertature of the cell.
		all_45C  :  45 C
		all_25C  :  25 C (25 degree C) ambient 
		all_n10C : -10 C
		all_0C	 :   0 C

	--- 'BB2590_drivecycle.mat' is a "drivecycle" generated by repeated application of a robot current profile and applied to the BB2590 pack.
	     The current demand for “drive cycle” data was taken from “Baseline Field Testing of BB-2590 Lithium-Ion Batteries using an iRobot FasTac 510 Robot”, report No. 21320 .
		See the accompanying file 'sensor_location.png' to attribute measurements to the correct sensor.
Files included
1) Plot_data.m 		: This file reads and plots the pulse profiles used for parametrization and the included drive-cycle data
2) sensor_location.png  : This picture helps locate the various temperature sensors when the BB2590 pack was utilized to provide power to track the "drive cycle"
